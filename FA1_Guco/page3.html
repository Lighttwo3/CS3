			<h1>Butcher</h1>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>Butcher is the third boss of Shadow Fight 2. He runs a gang of young, juvenile people. He misleads them into evil to create his own army.</li>
				<li>Butcher isn't a very hard boss but there are things you should watch out for about him.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>His weapons aren't that great at hitting, but they inflict MASSIVE damage and inflict bleeding.</li>
						<li>His stomps can kill you in one hit but are really avoidable. You can stay close toprevent him from stomping or just jump to not get hit.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>After defeating him, you move on to a land of pirates, on your way to a new threat, Wasp.</li>
			</ul>
