			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>Hermit is the 2nd boss of Shadow Fight 2. He runs a martial arts school in the Secret Path. His students are amazed at what unknown power he wields.</li>
				<li>Hermit can be a really annoying boss for newer players.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>His swords are quick and reliable. These can also enflict a status effect that can make your attacks weaker.</li>
						<li>He uses two types of magic: a lightning arrow and lightning summons. These both do a lot of damage.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>After defeating Hermit, you move on to the Trail of Blood. While Butcher awaits.</li>
